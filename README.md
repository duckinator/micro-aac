# Micro AAC

**WARNING:** This software is NOT ready for everyday use.

---

Micro AAC is _Augmentative and Alternative Communication_ (AAC)
software optimized for small non-touchscreen devices.

The two most common AAC designs are a _grid of buttons_ or _text area with keyboard_.
Micro AAC takes the approach of allowing rapid entry of arbitrary letters
using a small number of buttons. It is designed to be relatively straightforward
to implement on anything with a d-pad, 5 buttons, and a TTS library.


### Design Goals

Guiding principles & design considerations:
- Make it quick to learn.
- Optimize for a small number (<10) of physical buttons.
- Make it relatively straightforward to port to new platforms.
